		<p class = "fields"> MISSION STATEMENT: </p>
		<p> Bridged is a website partnered with a Senior Living Facility to bring a service that caters to both seniors who’d like to learn to use technology and teenagers who are able to volunteer and teach it. The purpose is to bridge the gap between seniors and teenagers using the medium of the digital age - technology.  Although we are currently partnering with just one senior living facility, Elk Ridge Village, it is our hope that we can partner with many different facilities using this same format. </p>

		<p class = "fields"> TARGET DEMOGRAPHIC: </p>
		<p> Bridged targets two consumer groups, seniors living in a Senior Living Facility and teenagers between the ages of 14 and 17. We built our site to be very user-friendly, with large text for seniors and easy navigation for both demographics. </p>

		<p class = "fields"> PURPOSE: </p>
		<p> In a time where technology is becoming a necessity, it’s important to have a good resource.  For many seniors, there isn’t a good way to get experience with technology without having to go to a class or struggle through trial and error. Seniors can browse on the site and connect with the Activity Director at their Senior Living Facility, the site’s administrator, and request to learn a variety of specific technology skills. There are six available skills in total, ranging from smart phone usage to social media. That is where the teenagers come in. Most teenagers need volunteer hours as a requirement for school, but also feel like they should relate it to an area that is relevant and meaningful to them. </p>
		<p> Of course, most teens are avid technology users and many would benefit from sessions teaching seniors what they know. In order to do so, a teenager must complete the form on our website to send their contact information to the administration side of the site.  The administration can then review the teens application.   In this application process, the teens must also select which areas they are most interested in teaching and then write an essay and provide contact information for further inquiry. The administrator from the senior facility will be able to view the teen’s application and partner teens and seniors.  Through this process, both teens and seniors can interact and learn from each other.  Potentially, it is an opportunity for both indiividuals to create a relationship beyond technology.</p>

		<p class = "fields"> DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY: </p>
		<p> Our site is fully functional and hosted on Heroku, ready to be put in use at www.omahabridged.herokuapp.com.  The next step is to coordinate with the site administrator and provide login information. </P>

		<p class = "fields"> FUTURE USE: </p> 
		<p> For the senior side of the web application, we have currently partnered with Elk Ridge Village. For the teen side, we plan to partner with the National Honor Society at Omaha North High Magnet School.  This will give us a pre-existing pool of knowledgeable and dedicated high school volunteers. Other options for teen volunteers are the teen technology group at Do Space.  Creative Catalysts have also expressed interest in partnering for further implementation. </p>
